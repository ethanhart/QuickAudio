QuickAudio
==========

Another test Android app for "Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps." This one plays audio.

This the second app for the aforementioned coursera class. This is another experiment in Android app development
and using git as version control for Android.

This application currently plays the Superman theme on start-up.
